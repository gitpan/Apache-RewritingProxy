NAME
    Apache::RewritingProxy - proxy that works by rewriting requested
    documents with no client proxy config needed.

SYNOPSIS
    # Configuration in httpd.conf

    <Location /foo> SetHandler perl-script PerlHandler
    Apache::RewritingProxy Options ExecCGI PerlSendHeader On
    </Location>

    requests to /foo/http://domain.dom/ will return the resource
    located at http://domain.dom with all links pointing to
    /foo/http://otherlink.dom

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows proxying of web sites without any
    configuration changes on the client's part. The client is simply
    pointed to a URL using this module and it fetches the resource
    and rewrites all links to continue using this proxy.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL; make; make install;

REQUIREMENTS
    You need the following modules installed for this module to
    work:

      LWP::UserAgent
      HTML::TokeParser
      URI::URL
      Of course, mod_perl and Apache would also help greatly.

TODO
    Make cookies work

    Fix occasional query string munging for redirected requests

    Add caching or incorporate some other caching mechanism

    Enable this module to at least print scripts that occur within
    comments

    Add an external script to enable this to be called as a cgi or a
    mod_perl module (for testing)

SEE ALSO
    mod_perl(3), Apache(3), LWP::UserAgent(3)
