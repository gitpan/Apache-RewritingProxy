NAME
    Apache::RewritingProxy - proxy that works by rewriting requested
    documents with no client proxy config needed.

SYNOPSIS
    # Configuration in httpd.conf

            <Location /foo>
            SetHandler perl-script
            PerlHandler Apache::RewritingProxy
            Options ExecCGI
            PerlSendHeader On
            </Location>

    requests to /foo/http://domain.dom/ will return the resource
    located at http://domain.dom with all links pointing to
    /foo/http://otherlink.dom

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows proxying of web sites without any
    configuration changes on the client's part. The client is simply
    pointed to a URL using this module and it fetches the resource
    and rewrites all links to continue using this proxy.

    RewritingProxy can also now be subclassed to allow users to
    write different handlers for the text. See the eg for examples
    of this in action.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL; make; make install;

REQUIREMENTS
    You need the following modules installed for this module to
    work:

      LWP::UserAgent
      HTML::TokeParser
      URI::URL
      Of course, mod_perl and Apache would also help greatly.
      Mod_Perl needs to have lots of hooks enabled.  Preferably ALL_HOOKS
      If not, the proxy will just give lots of server errors and not really
      do that much.  In particular, the Apache::Table and Apache::Util
      seem to be necessary for the module to run properly. 

TODO/BUGS
    Make cookies work better.

    Eat fewer cookies in real life.

    Add caching or incorporate some other caching mechanism.
