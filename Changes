Added Tim DiLauro's suggestions to fix the hardcoded
<Location > bug.  Basically this means that one can specify any
<Location Foo> Directive when configuring RewritingProxy and it should now
work.

Also added plenty of stuff to make cookies work a little better.

I fixed the version numbering to be consistent with the numbers under which
these files are being uploaded to CPAN.  This is really 0.5.  THere
had been some version cornfusion since I had cvs dump its own version
tag into the file.  Bad move.

Added bunches of code to build a cookie database on the server.  This
database stays there and the client is sent one cookie with the name of
the file.  When a request is made, the proxy sends only the cookies
that should go to the remote web server.  This works somewhat but is
not 100% and is not very elegant.  The file locking for the cookie
database file is very primitive.

Fixed some of the meta refresh pages.  I now see that
tag and rewrite the URL properly.  Cookies are still a
major problem.  It looks like I may have to build some
sort of cookie database and give the client a cookie poining
to his/her entry in that database. Looks like the safest way to go.

Added the version number and some other silliness I didn't know about
real perl modules.  Fixed Makefile.PL to actually check for the necessary
modules.

RewritingProxy.pm created.  Renamed from invisibleProxy.pm which
was not a terribly informative or relavant name.
