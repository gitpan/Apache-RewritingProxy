Miscellaneous cleanup.  This is pretty much version 0.7 of this guy.
Subclassing works.  Cookies work well.  Redirects work seemingly
perfectly.

RewritingProxy can now be subclassed and other handlers written.
See the README file in the eg directory for an attempt at an explanation
of how to do it.

JavaScript is handled better. RewritingProxy gets the right scripts
when someone uses <script src=...> in a document.

Regex handling is improved again.

Forms handling works better.

Referer now acts as it is supposed to.
User-Agent is also sent correctly.

Still some problems getting all cookies from the remote server.
The HTTP::Cookies stuff doesn't seem to be finding all of the cookies
sent to the proxy server.

Made lots of changes to the texthandler area.  I am trying to
find a simple way to enable someone else to subclass RewritingProxy
and provide their own textHandler method to parse the text content
differently.  Once that has been accomplished, imageHandler and
linkHandler will naturally follow quite soon.

The convoluted regexes escaping special chars in urls have been
all consolidated into one little subroutine.

Cookies are still written to a text file in an attempt to find out
why not all of them are stored.

REFERER is not being proxied properly.  REFERER is being sent as the
REFERER the client sees.  This needs to be fixed soon.  Should be fixed before
the next commit.

Took out the part of the cookie code that named the
cookie nnnnnnnnnnnn where the n's are part of the IP address.
The problem was that 136.165.1.128 would share a cookie jar with
136.165.11.28 and that would be bad.

Fixed a number of bugs relating to special characters such as
(,*,+,),% being in the url being parsed.

Fixed a problem I had parsing some sites with a huge first line of
text.  I wasn't printing out the headers properly and that line was
ignored.  I only noticed it when the first line was huge.

Still missing any handling of cookies set in the Meta HTTP-Equiv tag.

Fixed the Documentation to reflect the other modules that are needed.
Apache::Util
Apache::Table
are really needed for this thing to work.  The Makefile will need to
reflect this also.

Added Tim DiLauro's suggestions to fix the hardcoded
<Location > bug.  Basically this means that one can specify any
<Location Foo> Directive when configuring RewritingProxy and it should now
work.

Also added plenty of stuff to make cookies work a little better.

I fixed the version numbering to be consistent with the numbers under which
these files are being uploaded to CPAN.  This is really 0.5.  THere
had been some version cornfusion since I had cvs dump its own version
tag into the file.  Bad move.

Added bunches of code to build a cookie database on the server.  This
database stays there and the client is sent one cookie with the name of
the file.  When a request is made, the proxy sends only the cookies
that should go to the remote web server.  This works somewhat but is
not 100% and is not very elegant.  The file locking for the cookie
database file is very primitive.

Fixed some of the meta refresh pages.  I now see that
tag and rewrite the URL properly.  Cookies are still a
major problem.  It looks like I may have to build some
sort of cookie database and give the client a cookie poining
to his/her entry in that database. Looks like the safest way to go.

Added the version number and some other silliness I didn't know about
real perl modules.  Fixed Makefile.PL to actually check for the necessary
modules.

RewritingProxy.pm created.  Renamed from invisibleProxy.pm which
was not a terribly informative or relavant name.
